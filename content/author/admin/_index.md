I am a bioinformatician doing my PhD at the [IBD](https://ibd-bcn.org) lab of Dr. Julià Panès under the supervision of Azucena Salas. My research interests include functional enrichment, transcriptomics, data integration and analysis outside comparisons. I created some packages deposited in Bioconductor and contributed to other packages on CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub.
