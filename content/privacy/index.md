Please attribute the information if you want to use it. 

This website uses google analytics to keep me informed if someone read it. 
Unfortunately I cannot (don't know) how to configure so that you can disable it, so you need to accept that cookie and maybe some other for fonts and style. 

Let me  know via twitter if you found something useful, interesting or you disagree with something.
