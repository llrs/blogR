Many has been said about the relation of PCA and MDS. For instance [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/14017/105234), or [this other one](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/60759/105234) on the practical point of view, however it has been different. In R we have on base (really stats package) three functions: `prcomp`, `princomp` and `cmdscale`

We will compare the outpot of the three of them on this dataset:
```{r mock_up}
set.seed(547913)
x <- runif(100)
M <- matrix(x, ncol = 10, nrow = 10)
```

## prcomp

```{r prcomp}
stats:::prcomp.default
M_prcomp <- prcomp(M)
plot(M_prcomp$rotation)
M_prcomp$rotation[1:10, 1:2]
```

## princomp

```{r princomp}
stats:::princomp.default
M_princomp <- princomp(M)
plot(M_princomp$scores)
M_princomp$scores[1:10, 1:2]
```

## cmdscale

```{r cmdscale}
cmdscale
M_dist <- as.dist(M)
M_cmdscale <- cmdscale(M_dist)
plot(M_cmdscale)
```
