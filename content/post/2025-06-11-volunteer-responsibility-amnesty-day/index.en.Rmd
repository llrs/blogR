Recently I was pointed to [Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day](https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/) and given my situation and recent behavior I decided to re-evaluate my participation in at least one project:

Bioconductor:

 - **Responsibilities**: CAB member: Enabling productive and respectful participation, empowering developers at all levels of experience.
 - **What I'll keep**: answering developers' requests/questions by email. 
 - **Next steps**: 
    - I have notified the CAB secretary that I will take a long leave.
    - I have disengaged from current discussions within Bioconductor.
    - I notified the [EuroBioc2025](https://eurobioc2025.bioconductor.org/) organizer I won't attend or contribute more towards the conference organization. 
    - I have paused the notifications from the bioc-devel mailing list.

I am researching how/what to improve in my implication and participation with this and other projects. Other projects might be paused or won't keep volunteering (might update the post or write new ones).
