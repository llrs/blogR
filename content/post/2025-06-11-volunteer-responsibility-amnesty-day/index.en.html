<p>Recently I was pointed to <a href="https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</a> and given my situation and recent behavior I decided to re-evaluate my participation in at least one project:</p>
<p>Bioconductor:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: CAB member: Enabling productive and respectful participation, empowering developers at all levels of experience.</li>
<li><strong>What I’ll keep</strong>: answering developers’ requests/questions by email.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps</strong>:
<ul>
<li>I have notified the CAB secretary that I will take a long leave.</li>
<li>I have disengaged from current discussions within Bioconductor.</li>
<li>I notified the <a href="https://eurobioc2025.bioconductor.org/">EuroBioc2025</a> organizer I won’t attend or contribute more towards the conference organization.</li>
<li>I have paused the notifications from the bioc-devel mailing list.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I am researching how/what to improve in my implication and participation with this and other projects. Other projects might be paused or won’t keep volunteering (might update the post or write new ones).</p>
