```

First post  is on [Bioconductor submissions](https://llrs.dev/2020/06/bioconductor-submissions/) raised some questions comments but at the time I didn't have a good way to answer them:

- issues get closed after they got assigned a reviewer and before the reviewer actually gets a chance to start the review.
- issues assigned to multiple people or issues that switched reviewers

The common problem is that I didn't have the information available. 
On the previous post I only gathered the information of the state of the issues at that moment. 
This excluded label changes, reviewer changes, renaming the issues, who commented on the issues and many more things.
To retrieve these information from github I developed a [new package](https://llrs.dev/2020/06/social-github/) which downloads it from [Github](https://github.com) to make the analysis possible.

```{r reading}
library("socialGH")
repo <- "Bioconductor/Contributions"
gi <- get_issues(repo)
i <- unique(gi$id)
gt <- lapply(i, get_timelines, repository = repo)
saveRDS(gt, "static/2020083_timelines_Bioconductor_contributions.RDS")
gt <- readRDS("static/2020083_timelines_Bioconductor_contributions.RDS")
gt2 <- do.call(rbind, gt)
```

```{r prepare}
library("tidyverse")
library("stringr")
theme_set(theme_minimal())
gi2 <- gi %>% 
  select(-n_comments) %>% 
  mutate(actor = poster, event = "created")

g <- rbind(gi2[, colnames(gt2)], gt2)
g2 <- g %>% 
  arrange(id, created) %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(event_n = 1:n(),
         event = unlist(event, FALSE, FALSE),
         state = ifelse(event_n == 1, list("opened"), state))


i <- filter(g, event %in% c("merged", "committed"))
g2 <- filter(g2, !id %in% i$id) %>% 
  mutate(approved = any(vapply(label, 
                           function(x){"3a. accepted" %in% x}, logical(1L))),
         Approved = case_when(any(approved) ~ "Yes",
                              sum(event == "closed") >= sum(event == "reopen") ~ "No",
                              TRUE ~ "Ongoing"))
saveRDS(g2, file = "static/202008_github_data.RDS")
```

Now that we have more data about the issues we can plot them similarly to what we did on the previous post:

```{r first_plot}
# If not closed add the closing time of today
releases <- data.frame(release = paste0("3.", 3:12),
           date = as.POSIXct(c("2016/04/04", "2016/10/18", "2017/04/25", 
                            "2017/10/31", "2018/05/01", "2018/10/31", 
                            "2019/05/03", "2019/10/30", "2020/04/28",
                            "2020/10/01"), format = "%Y/%m/%d"),
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

scale_data <- scale_x_datetime(expand = expansion(add = 10), 
               limits = as.POSIXct(c("2016-06-01", "2020-06-10"), "%Y-%m-%d"))

cut <- 5
g2 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(created, id, col = fct_lump_n(event, cut),
                 shape = fct_lump_n(event, cut)), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = releases$date, col = "#1a81c2") + # Releases dates
  geom_text(data = releases, aes(x = date, y = c(rep(1200, 5), rep(300, 5)),
           label = release)) + # Release dates
  scale_data +
  labs(x = "Events", y = "Issue", col = "Type", shape = "Type",
       title = "Events on issues") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal") + 
  guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 1), shape = guide_legend(nrow = 1))
```

We can see that sometimes the issues remained silent for several months and then had a high level of events, or a single one (closing).

Compare to the pervious version it is surprising to see that one of the earliest issues still gets new events.

# Events

Looking a bit further on the issues we can look at the events that take place:

```{r second_plot}
g2 %>% 
  filter(event != "created") %>% 
  count(event) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(id, event, n) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(id, fct_reorder(event, n, .fun = sum), col = n)) +
  scale_color_continuous(expand = expansion(), trans = "log10", 
                         high = "#132B43", low = "#56B1F7") +
  # theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(y = element_blank(), x = "Issue", title = "Events per issue", col = "Times")
```

We can see that most issues have few events which agrees with the previous findings that issues are handled fairly and expeditiously.
The most common event are comments mentions and the rarest events are deleting comments, locking or referencing them. 

```{r events_time}
unit <- "days"
g2 %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  filter(event_n == max(event_n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(event_n), bins = 40) +
  labs(x = "Events", y = "Issues", title = "Events per issue")
diff_time <- g2 %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(open_time = difftime(max(created), min(created), units = unit),
            n = max(event_n), 
            id = unique(id),
            slope = n/as.numeric(open_time)) %>% 
  ungroup()
diff_time %>%   
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(open_time, n, col = slope)) +
  scale_color_continuous(expand = expansion(), trans = "log10",
                         high = "#132B43", low = "#56B1F7") +
  labs(y = "Events", x = glue::glue("Time open ({unit})"), 
       col = glue::glue("Events per {unit}"), 
       title = "Number of events and time open")

diff_time %>% 
  filter(open_time <= median(diff_time$open_time)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(open_time, n, col = slope)) +
  scale_color_continuous(expand = expansion(), trans = "log10", 
                         high = "#132B43", low = "#56B1F7") +
  labs(y = "Events", 
       x = glue::glue("Time open ({unit})"), 
       col = glue::glue("Events per {unit}"), 
       title = "Number of events and time open",
       subtitle = "A zoom to the fastest half")
```


```{r}
get_element <- function(x, name) {
  if (!is.null(names(x))) {
    getElement(x, name)
  } else {
    NA_character_
  }
} 

who <- g2 %>% 
  mutate(reviewer = vapply(assignee, get_element, name = "user", character(1)),
         actor = vapply(actor, get_element, name = "user", character(1L)))
assignments <- who %>% 
  filter(event %in% c("assigned", "unassigned", "commented", "created", "closed")) %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(n = sum(event %in% "assigned"),
         reasigned  = any(event %in% "unassigned"),
         reviewers = n - sum(event %in% "unassigned"))

assignments %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_count(aes(reviewers, n, col = reasigned)) +
  scale_radius(trans = "log10") +
  labs(x = "Final reviewers", y = "Assigned", title = "Reviewers", 
       col = "Reassigned?") +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("No", "Yes"))
```

We can see that usually some adjustment to reviewers is made usually assigning more reviewers but also changing them. 

```{r}
trelative <- function(x) {
  created <- x$created
  event <- x$event
  start <- created[event == "created"]
  k <- event == "closed"
  if (any(k)){
    closing <- created[which.max(k)]
  } else {
    closing <- max(created)
  }
  
  o <- difftime(created[!is.na(created)], start, units = "days")
  as.numeric(o)
}

a <- assignments %>%
  nest_by() %>% 
  summarize(t = trelative(data), created = data$created) %>% 
  inner_join(assignments)

a %>% 
  filter(Approved == "No" & any(!is.na(reviewer))) %>% 
  mutate(reviewer_commented = any(event[actor %in% reviewer[!is.na(reviewer)]] == "commented")) %>% 
  filter(!reviewer_commented & actor != "bioc-issue-bot",
         reviewers == 1 & !is.na(reviewer)) %>% 
  select(id, reviewer, reviewer_commented, Approved) %>% 
  mutate(reviewer = last(reviewer[!is.na(reviewer)])) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  count(reviewer, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
revi <- a %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  filter(reviewers == 1 & any(!is.na(reviewer))) %>% 
  summarise(reviewer_commented = any(event[actor %in% last(reviewer[!is.na(reviewer)])] == "commented"),
         reviewer = last(reviewer[!is.na(reviewer)]),
         id = unique(id),
         Approved = unique(Approved),
         closer = last(actor[event == "closed"]),
         creator = unique(actor[event == "created"]))

reviwer_didnt_close <- revi %>% 
  filter(closer != reviewer & Approved == "No") %>% 
  pull(id)

author_closed <- revi %>% filter(closer == creator) %>% 
  pull(id)

revi %>% filter(closer != creator) %>% ungroup() %>% count(closer, reviewer, sort = TRUE)
  
revi_sum <- revi %>% 
  filter(!id %in% author_closed) %>% 
  group_by(reviewer, reviewer_commented, Approved) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(reviewer) %>% 
  mutate(perc = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(reviewer, reviewer_commented, Approved)

ord_rev <- revi_sum %>% summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% arrange(-total) %>% pull(reviewer)

r <- revi_sum %>% 
  mutate(reviewer_commented = ifelse(reviewer_commented, "commented", "not commented"),
         Approved = ifelse(Approved == "Yes", "Approved", "Rejected"),
         reviewer = as.factor(reviewer)) %>% 
  mutate(reviewer = fct_relevel(reviewer, !!!ord_rev)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  nest_by(Approved, reviewer_commented) %>% 
  mutate(plot_relative = list(
    ggplot(data) +
      geom_col(aes(reviewer, perc)) +
      labs(title = paste(Approved, reviewer_commented), x = element_blank(), y = "Percentage") +
      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
      scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
      scale_fill_brewer(type =  "qual") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)) ),
    plot_abs = list(
    ggplot(data) +
      geom_col(aes(reviewer, n)) +
      labs(title = paste(Approved, reviewer_commented), x = element_blank(), y = "Issues") +
      scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
      scale_fill_brewer(type =  "qual") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)) ))

r$plot_relative[[1]] <- r$plot_relative[[1]] + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

revi_sum %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(reviewer, perc, fill = Approved, group = reviewer_commented))
```

Issues submitted with a reviewer assigned that were closed by someone else rather than the poster.


```{r}
a %>% 
  filter(Approved == "Yes" & any(!is.na(reviewer))) %>% 
  mutate(reviewer_commented = any(event[actor %in% reviewer[!is.na(reviewer)]] == "commented")) %>% 
  filter(!reviewer_commented & actor != "bioc-issue-bot") %>% 
  select(id, Approved, reviewer_commented) %>% 
  distinct()

  summarise(closed_not_reviewed = all(Approved == "No") & !any(actor %in% reviewer)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  count(closed_not_reviewed)
  
```


There seems to be 565 submissions that were closed without any reviewer commenting. 
That's around a 35% of issues. 



```{r}
a %>% 
  filter(id != 51) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(t, event_n, col = id))
  
```

I skiped an issue that seems for testing the process
```{r}
who_what <- who %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(diff_events = n_distinct(event), 
         diff_actors = n_distinct(actor),
         events = n())

ggplot(who_what) +
  geom_bar(aes(as.factor(diff_events))) +
  labs(y = "Issues", x = element_blank(), 
       title = "Different events in the issue")
ggplot(who_what) +
  geom_bar(aes(as.factor(diff_actors))) +
  labs(y = "Issues", x = element_blank(), 
       title = "Different users involved in the issue")
```

While most issues have at least 8 different events they usually have 4 users involved.
Presumably the creator of the issue, bioc-issue-bot, a reviewer and someone else. 

```{r}
ggplot(who_what) +
  geom_count(aes(as.factor(diff_actors), as.factor(diff_events))) +
  labs(x = "Users", y = "Events", title = "Users and events") +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) 
```


# Who does each action ?

We can look now at who performs what, we know there are `r n_distinct(who$actor)` participants:

```{r who}
who %>% 
  group_by(event, actor, .add = FALSE) %>% 
  count(sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n > 30) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(aes(fct_reorder2(event, -n, actor), 
                fct_reorder(actor, n, .fun = sum), 
                fill = n)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = "log10", expand = expansion()) +
  labs(title = "Events by users", y = element_blank(), x = element_blank())
```

Here I cut at people who have triggered more than 30 events. 
We can clearly see who are official reviewers (as seen on the previous post) because they labeled and unlabeled issues.
bioc-issue-bot is an special user that makes lots of comments and assigning reviewers to issues.

# Bioconductor Bot

We have seen that one of the most relevant "users" is bioc-issue-bot. 
It is a bot that performs and report automatic checks on the submissions (The code can be found [here](https://github.com/Bioconductor/issue_tracker_github)). 
Let's explore what does and what does it report

```{r}
bioc_bot <- who %>% 
  filter(actor == "bioc-issue-bot" & event == "commented") %>% 
  mutate(reason = case_when(
    startsWith(text, "Hi @") ~ "Received",
    startsWith(text, "Received a valid push") ~ "Valid push",
    str_detect(text, "^(\n)?Dear Package contributor,") ~ "Build result",
    startsWith(text, "A reviewer has been assigned to your package") ~ "Reviewer assigned",
    str_detect(text, "There is no repository called") ~ "Missing repository",
    str_detect(text, "Thanks for submitting your additional package") ~ "Additional package",
    str_detect(text, "has already posted ") ~ "repost",
    str_detect(text, "for an extended period of time") ~ "Closing",
    str_detect(text, "DESCRIPTION file") ~ "Unmatch",
    str_detect(text, "Your package has been approved for building") ~ "Building",
    str_detect(text, "We only start builds when the `Version`") ~ "Update version",
    str_detect(text, "a GitHub repository URL") ~ "Missing repository",
    str_detect(text, "more than one GitHub URL") ~ "Multiple repositories",
    str_detect(text, "Add SSH keys") ~ "SSH key",
    startsWith(text, "Your package has been accepted.") ~ "Accepted",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
cm <- bioc_bot %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  count(reason, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup()
cm %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(id, fct_reorder(reason, n, .fun = sum), col = n)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(trans = "log10", expand = expansion()) +
  labs(x = "Issue", title = "Automated comments from bioc-issue-bot", 
       y = element_blank())
```

Classifying the comments reports that most of the comments are build results or that received a valid push. 
However, it also reports common problems on the submission: missing repository, unmatch between the repository name and the package name, reposting the same package, missing SSH key (needed to be able to push to Bioconductor git server), ...

```{r}
cm %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(id, n)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 200))
cm %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(id, n, col = reason, group = reason)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 200))
```

More or less the Bioc-issue-bot posts the same number of comments along issues.

```{r}
bm <- bioc_bot %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(valid_push = sum(valid_push), 
            build = sum(build), 
            no_repo = sum(no_repo), 
            additional_pkg = sum(additional_pkg),
            repost = sum(repost),
            auto_close = sum(auto_close),
            no_desc = sum(no_desc),
            n = n(),
            n_out = n - valid_push - build - no_repo - additional_pkg - repost - auto_close - no_desc
            )
bm %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(valid_push, build, col = n_out))
```
