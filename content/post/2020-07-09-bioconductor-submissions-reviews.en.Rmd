First post  is on [Bioconductor submissions](https://llrs.dev/2020/06/bioconductor-submissions/) raised some questions comments but at the time I didn't have a good way to answer them:

- issues get closed after they got assigned a reviewer and before the reviewer actually gets a chance to start the review.
- issues assigned to multiple people or reviews that switched reviewers

The common problem is that I didn't have the information available. To retrieve the information from github I developed a [new package](https://llrs.dev/2020/06/social-github/) which .
