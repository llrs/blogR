```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, fig.retina = 2)
```

I'm very excited to announce that rtweet 1.2.0 is now available on GitHub! Install it by running:

```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rtweet")
```

Then load it in a fresh session with:

```r
library(rtweet)
```

# New features 

This version adds many new endpoints to retrieve data from twitter:

- From lists
  
- From tweets

- About users
  
- Also, about statistics of your own content.

You can read about them in the [NEWS](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/news/index.html).


# Authentication

Besides fixing a problem preventing new users to use `auth_setup_default()`, in this release there is a new authentication mechanism.

Some endpoints require a new authentication method not previously used by rtweet.
This authentication mechanism requires setting up a client.  
To support it, I have added some functions to create it, save it, and use it modelling the functions from `auth_*`.
There is now one client provided by rtweet if you don't want to configure your own:

```r
client_setup_default()
```

Additionally, I briefly expanded the authentication vignette (`vignette("auth", "rtweet")`) to include a section about how to obtain the required credentials. 
Once you get them is pretty straight forward:

```r
auth_oauth2 <- rtweet_oauth2(app = "my_awesome_app")
```

This mechanism is required by some functions which are of special interest: `user_self()`, `tweet_bookmarked()`, `user_blocked()`, and `user_timeline()`.

Note that due to upstream reasons, the authentication is only valid for 2 hours.
You will be asked to approve the client again after the 2 hours (and save it again!). 

We can set the authentication as we usually do:

```r
auth_as(auth_oauth2)
```

And start retrieving our data in Twitter!

# New functions

```r
me <- user_self()
bookmarked <- user_bookmarks(me$id, n = 120)
```

rtweet will make as many requests as needed and automatically paginate the results.
However, if you try this you might realize that the queries are slow.
These are the limits imposed by Twitter.

If you want to keep track of the progress of your query, you can use `verbose = TRUE`:

```r
blocked <- user_blocked(me$id, n = Inf, verbose = TRUE)
timeline <- user_timeline(me$id, n = 800, verbose = TRUE)
```

It will also store the data of the requests in a temporary file, in case you lose the connection you can still recover it. 

Some endpoints have a length limit on the accepted input:

```r
bioconductor <- user_by_username("Bioconductor")
bioconductor_followers <- user_followers(bioconductor$id, n = 200)
us <- user_search(ids = bioconductor_followers$id)
```

Errors are, in principle, easier to understand in these new functions, thanks to the messages provided:

```r
user_blocked(bioconductor$id, n = Inf, verbose = TRUE)
```

# Other

These new endpoints provide access to many data which only the default information is converted to a nice table.
If you request more data, via expansions and fields: replies, information about the user of a tweet, ... you will have to wait next release.  
You can already get them but with `parse = FALSE`.
My intention was to provide more parsing support in this release, but I think it is better to make more releases more often.

The API also provides an endpoint to check if data stored is compliant with the Terms of Service.
I started working on these endpoints after the streaming endpoints because they are important.

# Side story

With the deprecation of the streaming endpoints and the function `stream_tweets` I implemented the first three functions using Twitter's API v2. 
They use a bearer token as authentication mechanism.

Many endpoints of API v2 also use this authentication mechanism and made it easy  to support them.

But there was a petition to retrieve the bookmarked tweets.
That endpoint required OAuth2 mechanism and didn't allow the use of the bearer token. 
It is relevant because bookmarks are not provided with the data dump you can request from Twitter.
This endpoint is the only automatic way to retrieve them from Twitter if you used them!

# Final

This update is the last update of rtweet.
The [new API plans](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1641222782594990080) make it impossible to continue developing and testing software like rtweet without substantial financial investment (at least USD$100/month).  

More importantly, this will restrict who can use the package.
I think those few users still using rtweet might also afford to pay for support or development of new features.
If you are one of them you can [sponsor my work](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/llrs) in rtweet.

I will remove the package from CRAN one month after the new API enters into effect (~ 1st July). 
Farewell Twitter.
