I am following [Yongfu's blog](https://yongfu.name/2018/12/13/hugo_rss.html):
I copy here the content in case it is moved:

>     Copy the default RSS template

>    Change <description>{{ .Summary | html }}</description> to <description>{{ .Content | html }}</description>

>    Create subdirectories in layouts/ and save the RSS template files (name them rss.xml) in them (one for each subdirectory).

I was first confused when I wanted to copy the rss.xml file mentioned and didn't know where to go.
I finally found the [section](https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/#the-embedded-rssxml) from which I could go to the file I was supposed to copy. 

So far so good, so without further testing I assume this worked. 
Following [the instructions](https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/), I moved the rss.xml file to `layouts/post/` to only report posts of the blog, not new projects or other leafs from Hugo.

I also created a rss.xml on `layouts/categories/`. 
As the templates provided by gohugo.io didn't work I copied and pasted the [files from Yongfu's Blog](https://github.com/liao961120/Hugo-RSS/tree/master/layouts).

To check that it worked I went to [`llr.dev/categories/cran/index.xml`](https://llr.dev/categories/cran/index.xml).
Surprisingly it worked for some categories but not for others ([r](https://llr.dev/categories/r/index.xml)), so I needed to tweak the layout.

I set a limit of 20 post on the config.toml file `rssLimit = 20`.
