<p>I write this post after several weeks/months of consideration of why I am feeling a burden when I contribute to the FOSS community, mostly the R community.
I want to make public some rules I set for myself for future references and in case it helps others.</p>
<div id="how-i-end-up-here" class="section level1">
<h1>How I end up here</h1>
<p>I use R for my work and I realized I could use it for my interests.
With the creativity of a computer language that I know well, I could answer question I had and help others in the process.</p>
<p>As the questions I answered were more general or more community centered I got involved in more meetings and working groups.
Some decisions/commitments were carefully considered, and known to be temporal, others were/are more open ended with an unclear end.</p>

<div id="current-situation" class="section level1">
<h1>Current situation</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I often participate to the <a href="https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group" title="RCWG webpage">R Contributors working group (RCWG)</a>, not only meetings but other activities and task.</li>
<li>I am member of the <a href="https://bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a>, helping in the forum from time to time<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</li>
<li>I am member of the Bioconductor code of conduct committee.</li>
<li>I am member of the <a href="https://ropensci.org">rOpenSci community</a>, helping in the slack and in the forum if the questions are related to the packages I have in their organization.</li>
<li>I am member of the <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg" title="RRepoWG github repository">R repository working group (RRepoWG) from the R Foundation</a>.</li>
<li>I impulsed the Bioconductor Classes and Methods Working Group (although there isn’t much activity for the last year and a half).</li>
<li>I co-organized the local R conference of my country for 2023.</li>
<li>I co-organized the local R user group of my city last year (2-3 events) and I’ve been trying to restart it this year 2024 and contributed to others RUGs.</li>
<li>I maintain 3-4 packages on CRAN and Bioconductor<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am sure there are several people doing more but after reflection I came to the conclusion that this is not sustainable/worth it for me.</p>
</div>
<div id="reasons-to-keep-giving" class="section level1">
<h1>Reasons to keep giving</h1>
<p>From now on when I contribute something there are 3 reasons I will keep in mind:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is part of my <strong>work</strong> or related to it.</p>
<p>When I go to these working groups I do not represent my employer or any comunity.
I am not paid for anything of the previous list and I need to recover the hours when I have meetings during working hours.</p>
<p>Here I also include contributions to something that might make help my career.
This includes gig jobs or consulting that I am open to do.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <strong>fun</strong>ny/rewarding.</p>
<p>These contributions might interest me because I find funny, for example plotting a simple tree with ggplot2.</p>
<p>Or because it is rewarding helping someone to solve their problems, such as helping a family member to claim her wage for their overtime.</p></li>
<li><p>I <strong>learn</strong> something.</p>
<p>I don’t like to learn new things for the sake of learning.
But I enjoy learning something that could be useful: a technology, a solution, a community or new data I never analyzed.
This might be for my personal interest or work related: recently having learn how to parse html/xml helped me at work doing a task in 5 minutes a simple task my boss would have need half an hour or more but I learned it for a hobby project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If I see a project/proposal doesn’t fit any of these three I will stop contributing/maintaining.
I’ll try to avoid commitments that I think that should be done that I could step up or do it but do not fit in these three rules.
This includes contributing to books, mentoring, being the glue between different communities or simply sending a PR.</p>
<p>As my time is more stretched with commitments away from the keyword.
I feel torn apart between contributing more effectively or stopping.
Each hour I spend in a meeting that could/was an email is 2 hours or more that I lose, not only the opportunity cost but also the motivation<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the time I spent preparing the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-contributions" class="section level1">
<h1>Future contributions</h1>
<p>Aside from that and some previous commitments I will finish serving the community.
I will no longer prioritize what is good for the community over what is good for me.
If they overlap it will be great if it doesn’t, I’m sorry.</p>

<p>As you now know you can appeal to either of the three motivations now: Ask me something I might find funny/rewarding, ask me to learn something I could use or simply provide a payment or a way forward for my career.</p>
<p>I am open to consulting or developing something, you can contact me useing the <a href="lluis.revilla@gmail.com" class="mailito">email on the blog</a>.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I also receive answers and help too when I occasionally ask too.
I also benefit of many questions from online forums (although now it is rare those I search are about R).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>There are many more only in github or some other communities.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Which frankly lately is very low.
I won’t get into details.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
