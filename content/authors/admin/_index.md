I am a bioinformatician currently doing a PhD at the [IBD](https://ibd-bcn.org) lab of Dr. [Julian Panès](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4971-6902) under the joint supervision of [Azucena Salas](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4572-2907) and [Juanjo Lozano](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7613-3908). My research interests include data integration (my PhD topic) and functional enrichment.  
Other interest are helping with data to make better decisions and improve processes,  from transparency, lawyer activities, media handling to open source activities.
To be more effective at this I'm in touch with some organizations and I created some packages deposited in [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BioCor/), [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_lluis.revilla_at_gmail.com.html), [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), [rOpenSpain](https://ropenspain.es/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/llrs).  
Outside programming I enjoy hiking, jumping rope and diabolo as hobbies.
