I am a bioinformatician currently at the [T-cell immunogenicity virus (TIV) group](https://www.irsicaixa.es/en/host-genetics-and-cellular-immunity) led by [Christian Brander](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0548-5778) at [IrsiCaixa](https://www.irsicaixa.es/en).
My academic research interests include data integration (my Ph.D. topic) and functional enrichment.


Besides my work in biomedicine, I use my skills to make data transparency accessible.
I mainly use [R](https://r-project.org)  to gather data and answer questions to provide insights and make informed decisions. 
I collaborate with several organizations [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) and  [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BioCor/), where I maintain some packages, [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_lluis.revilla_at_gmail.com.html), [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), [rOpenSpain](https://ropenspain.es/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/llrs).  
Outside programming I enjoy hiking, jumping rope, and diabolo as hobbies.
