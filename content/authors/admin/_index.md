I am a bioinformatician currently at the [IBD](https://ibd-bcn.org) lab of [Azucena Salas](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4572-2907). 
I use [R](https://r-project.org) to gather data and answer questions to provide insights and make a more informed decisions.
My academic research interests include data integration (my PhD topic) and functional enrichment.

Besides research in biomedicine I use my skills to make data transparency accessible.
To be more effective at this I collaborate with some organizations [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) and I created some packages deposited in [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BioCor/), [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_lluis.revilla_at_gmail.com.html), [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), [rOpenSpain](https://ropenspain.es/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/llrs).  
Outside programming I enjoy hiking, jumping rope and diabolo as hobbies.
