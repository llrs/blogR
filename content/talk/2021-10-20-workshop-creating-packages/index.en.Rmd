I was invited by Francis Mensha on R-devel slack to give this workshop on April 29th for the R User Group Ghana.

First time teaching R stats and remote I expected people to follow the workshop and run the code and then ask questions but I was asked to do it myself. Hope it was easy enough to follow.
