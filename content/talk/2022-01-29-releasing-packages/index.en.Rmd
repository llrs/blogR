On this presentation invited by the R User Group Ghana on the celebration of their 3rd anniversary. 
I presented a mix of data from previous work:

 - from the [workshop](talk/workshop-creating-packages/) I did for them for how to create packages.
 - from the [useR!2021 talk](talk/user-2021/) about submitting packages to CRAN
 - About keeping packages on CRAN based on a [previous blog post](post/2021/12/07/reasons-cran-archivals/).
 
 The slides are on the link on the top and here below as embedded:
