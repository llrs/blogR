<p>On this presentation invited by the R User Group Ghana on the celebration of their 3rd anniversary.
I presented a mix of data from previous work:</p>
<ul>
<li>from the <a href="talk/workshop-creating-packages/">workshop</a> I did for them for how to create packages.</li>
<li>from the <a href="talk/user-2021/">useR!2021 talk</a> about submitting packages to CRAN</li>
<li>About keeping packages on CRAN based on a <a href="post/2021/12/07/reasons-cran-archivals/">previous blog post</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The slides are on the link on the top and here below as embedded:</p>
