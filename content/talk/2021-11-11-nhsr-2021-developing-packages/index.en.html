<p>I was invited to give this talk shortly after <a href="/talk/user-2021/">my talk at useR!2021</a>.
I was very nervous because I would like to have such a community on Spain and work together with them.</p>
<p>I presented a about how R can be used on the public medical sector to enhance and improve analysis and their reproducibility.</p>
